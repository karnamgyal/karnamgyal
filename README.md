## What I'm Working On

#### 🦾 [Post-Stroke Rehabilitation (UTMIST)](https://github.com/post-stroke-rehab)
Developing signal-processing pipelines and deep learning models (CNNs/LSTMs/GNNs) for upper-limb and finger movement decoding from sEMG signals, integrated into a neurorehabilitation device.

## Projects

#### 🧠 [EEG Sleep Stage Classifier](https://github.com/karnamgyal/sleep-stage-classifier) 
Predicts sleep stages from time-series EEG/EOG/EMG recordings using a CNN-LSTM model.

#### 🧩 [NEOFFI Personality Trait Regressor](https://github.com/karnamgyal/APS360-NEOFFI-Project)
Predicts Big Five personality traits from brain connectivity matrices derived from resting-state fMRI data.

#### 📷 [Verbatim (2nd @ Hack Without Borders)](https://github.com/karnamgyal/HWB_Project)
Built a Python tool using OpenCV that converts live camera text to speech for visually impaired users.
